For larger or more complex productions, we build in more time to ensure the concept is properly stress-tested before we move into production." },

This development phase is essential and often shapes the final form of the film significantly. We work collaboratively with clients throughout and won't commit to a full production until we're confident the story is there." },

Animation is excellent for abstract concepts, processes and products that don't physically exist or can't easily be filmed. Live action is often stronger for building trust and human connection, particularly in B2B or professional services contexts. A hybrid approach, combining live action with animated elements, often gives you the best of both. We'll recommend the right approach for your brief." },

Getting the words right first makes everything that follows significantly more straightforward." },

A straightforward animated explainer typically starts from around £3,000 to £5,000. A fully produced live action explainer with multiple locations and on-screen talent would be more.

    "As a video production company based in London, Klaxon Studio works with brands, agencies and organisations across the City - from established names in the city centre, through to ambitious companies in east London's creative corridor and beyond.",
    "We know the locations, we know the logistics, and we know what it takes to produce exceptional content in one of the world's most demanding production environments. London presents both enormous opportunity and genuine complexity for video production.",
    "The access requirements, location permits, traffic logistics and sheer density of the city mean that productions here require a level of local knowledge and operational precision that you can only develop through experience. We've spent years building that experience - and the network of trusted London-based crew, suppliers and location contacts that comes with it.",
    "We produce the full range of video content for London clients, from brand films, corporate videos and social content through to documentaries, product films and broadcast productions.",
    "London also means access to an extraordinary range of filming locations such as iconic architecture, world-class studios, diverse neighbourhoods and some of the most visually distinctive urban environments on the planet. We know how to make the city work for your production, not against it.",
    "If you're looking for a video production company in London that combines genuine creative quality with the operational expertise to deliver the city, we should talk."

    {
      "q": "Where in London are you based?",
      "a": "We're based in Bermondsey, South London and work across the whole city and the wider South East. We're equally comfortable filming in the City, the West End, east London, south London and anywhere else a project takes us. For productions outside London, we have crew and contacts across the UK."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do you work with London-based businesses exclusively?",
      "a": "Not at all. While a significant part of our work is with London clients, we produce content for organisations across the UK and internationally. London is our home base, but our work takes us well beyond it on a regular basis."
    },
    {
      "q": "What types of London businesses do you typically work with?",
      "a": "We work across a very wide range of sectors including financial and professional services, technology, consumer brands, hospitality, sport, healthcare, charity and more. What our clients have in common isn't sector but ambition - they want to make video content that is genuinely good, not just adequate. That's who we're built for."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can you help with filming permits for London locations?",
      "a": "Yes. London has specific permitting requirements - the Royal Parks, TfL-managed locations, the City of London and many private locations all have their own processes. Navigating these efficiently is something we do regularly and are well practised at. We handle the permit process as part of our production management service."

  "lead": "Got a question? We've probably been asked it before!",
  "intro": "Video production can feel like unfamiliar territory if you haven't commissioned it before and even experienced clients sometimes want a straight answer to a straightforward question. Here are the ones we get asked most often.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "Getting started",
      "qas": [
        {
          "q": "How do I commission a video with Klaxon Studio?",
          "a": "The simplest starting point is a conversation. Get in touch with a rough outline of what you're looking for, even if it's just a problem that needs solving rather than a fully formed brief, and we'll set up a call to talk it through. From there we'll develop a proposal covering creative approach, production plan and budget. We don't need everything figured out upfront; some of our best projects have started with very little more than an idea."
        },
        {
          "q": "What information do I need to get a quote?",
          "a": "The more context you can give us the better, but you don't need to have everything worked out. Helpful things to know upfront include: what the video is for, who the audience is, where it will be used, any sense of budget, and when you need it delivered. If you're not sure about some of those things yet, that's fine, we can help you work through them as part of the briefing process."
        },
        {
          "q": "How do we know if video is the right solution for what we're trying to achieve?",
          "a": "It usually is, but the format, length and approach matter enormously. A well-made sixty-second film and a poorly conceived ten-minute production can have completely opposite effects on an audience. That's why we always start with the objective rather than the output. If video is the right tool for what you're trying to achieve, we'll tell you. If a different approach would serve you better, we'll tell you that too."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do you work with clients who have never commissioned video before?",
          "a": "Yes, and we enjoy it. First-time commissioners often bring a freshness to the briefing process that's genuinely valuable; they ask the questions that more experienced clients sometimes stop asking. We take the time to explain each stage of the process clearly and make sure you always know what's happening and why."

      "heading": "Working with us",
      "qas": [
        {
          "q": "What size of businesses do you work with?",
          "a": "We work with organisations of all sizes, from ambitious startups and growing SMEs through to global corporates, broadcasters and household name brands. The common thread isn't size but ambition: our clients want to make video content that is genuinely good, and they understand the value of investing in getting it right."
        },
        {
          "q": "How involved do we need to be in the production process?",
          "a": "As involved as you want to be. Some clients prefer to hand over a brief and trust us to run with it, checking in at key approval stages. Others want to be closely involved throughout. We're comfortable working either way. We'll agree a communication and approval process at the start of the project that works for your team."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do you sign NDAs?",
          "a": "Yes. We're happy to sign non-disclosure agreements before discussions begin if you're sharing commercially sensitive information as part of the briefing process. Just let us know and we'll sort it before the first call."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can we see examples of your previous work before we commit?",
          "a": "Yes, our showreel and case studies are on the website, and we're happy to share more specific examples relevant to your sector or project type on request. If you'd like to see work we've produced for clients in a similar space to yours, just ask."

    {
      "heading": "Production",
      "qas": [
        {
          "q": "How long does it take to make a video?",
          "a": "It depends on the complexity of the project. A straightforward single-shoot film can move from brief to delivery in two to three weeks. A more complex production involving multiple locations, contributors or a significant post-production workload would typically take six to ten weeks. We'll always give you a realistic timeline upfront and flag early if anything looks like it might affect delivery."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do you handle everything in-house or do you use freelancers?",
          "a": "Both. We have a core in-house team that leads and oversees every project, supplemented by a trusted network of experienced freelance crew and specialists where the project demands it. Every person we bring onto a production, whether staff or freelance, is someone we know, have worked with before, and trust to deliver to our standards."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can you film anywhere in the UK?",
          "a": "Yes. We're based in London but regularly travel across the UK. We have crew contacts in most major cities and are comfortable coordinating productions anywhere in the country and internationally when required."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do you travel outside the UK?",
          "a": "Yes. While the majority of our work is UK-based, we have extensive experience filming internationally and are completely comfortable taking productions abroad. We've worked across a wide range of international locations and understand the requirements to coordinate a production outside of the UK - the logistics, the local considerations, and the planning required to make it run smoothly. If your project takes us overseas, we're ready for it."
        },
        {
          "q": "What happens if something goes wrong on a shoot day?",
          "a": "We plan thoroughly precisely so that the chances of something going wrong are minimised. But productions are unpredictable, and when things shift (and they sometimes do) our job is to solve the problem quickly and quietly without it becoming your problem. We'll always keep you informed and, where necessary, agree on the best way forward together."

      "qas": [
        {
          "q": "How much does a video cost?",
          "a": "The honest answer is that it varies enormously depending on what you're making. A simple interview-based film shot in a single location is a very different proposition to a multi-day commercial production with locations, talent and extensive post-production. As a rough guide, professionally produced video content from Klaxon typically starts from around £3,000 to £5,000 for straightforward projects, rising significantly for more complex productions. We provide detailed, transparent quotes for every project - get in touch and we'll give you an honest picture of what your project is likely to cost."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do you work with fixed budgets?",
          "a": "Yes. If you have a fixed budget, tell us what it is and we'll tell you honestly what we can deliver within it. We'd always rather have that conversation upfront than propose something that doesn't fit and waste everyone's time. Working to a defined budget often produces more creative solutions anyway."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do you require a deposit?",
          "a": "Yes. We typically require a deposit at the point of project confirmation, with the balance due on delivery. Full payment terms are set out in our Terms of Engagement, which we'll share as part of the project agreement."

      "heading": "After delivery",
      "qas": [
        {
          "q": "What format will we receive the finished video in?",
          "a": "We deliver in whatever format or formats your project requires - broadcast masters, digital files, social-optimised versions and everything in between. We'll agree delivery specifications at the start of the project so there are no surprises at the end."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do you retain the project files after delivery?",
          "a": "We retain project files and master assets for an agreed period following delivery. If you think you might need to make changes or create additional versions in the future, it's worth discussing archiving arrangements at the outset. We'd always recommend clients keep their own copies of all final deliverables."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can we come back to you for additional versions or edits after the project is closed?",
          "a": "Yes. We're happy to produce additional versions, cutdowns or edits from existing projects. Depending on how much time has passed and what's required, we'd agree a cost for any additional work before proceeding."

      { q: "Can you work within a fixed budget?", a: "Yes. If you come to us with a budget, we'll tell you honestly what's achievable within it. Sometimes that means scaling the brief, sometimes the budget fits exactly. Either way, you'll know upfront." },
