/**
 * Curated internal-link graph for the service pages.
 *
 * Why this exists: every `/services/*` page was a link island. Nothing pointed
 * into it except the `/services` index and the nav, and nothing pointed out of
 * it at all. GSC (Aug 2026) had the whole set sitting at average positions
 * 45-72 with real impressions — Google understood the topics but had no reason
 * to treat any single page as authoritative. These maps give each service page
 * inbound links from the blog (the only part of the site earning non-brand
 * clicks, at positions 5-8) and outbound links to sibling services and proof.
 *
 * Deliberately hand-curated rather than derived from `Project.cat`: there are
 * only six category values across 27 projects, so anything automatic maps a
 * dozen unrelated projects onto each of the 23 services. Editorial relevance is
 * the whole point — a link a reader would actually follow is the only kind that
 * carries weight.
 *
 * Blog posts live in Sanity and carry no taxonomy field. Mapping by slug here
 * avoids a schema change plus a re-tagging pass in the Studio. If posts ever
 * gain a `services` reference array, this map is the thing to delete.

 * broken arbitrarily) and every service page ends up with at least one in-content
