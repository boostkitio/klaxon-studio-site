/**
 * Everything the public site wraps around a page: nav, footer, structured

 *
 * This lives beside the root layout rather than in it so that /studio, which
 * shares the same root, renders as a bare Sanity Studio - no site nav bar
 * eating the top of the editor, and no analytics loaded behind it. The global
 * not-found page sits at the root too, so it opts in here explicitly.
